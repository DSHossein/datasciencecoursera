The dataset includes the following files:
 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector. 

* 'features.txt': List of all features. 
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the activity ID with their activity name. 
*  Training set. 
* Training labels. 
* Test set. 
* : Test labels. 
* subject_id_train: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

* subject_id: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
